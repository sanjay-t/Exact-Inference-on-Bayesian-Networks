# Exact-Inference-on-Bayesian-Networks

This project creates a set of nodes, combines them to form a Bayesian Network with respect to the given input and does exact inference to output the probability of events occuring. 

Using enumeration techniques, I have derived specific derived probabilities, joint probabilities and conditional probabilities depending on the decision nodes and their values.

Expected utilities and Maximum Expected Utility is derived where there are one or moe unset decsion nodes.
